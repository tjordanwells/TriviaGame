# TriviaGame

The user will have 30 seconds to answer each question. If the timer runs out, the quiz will alert the user that the time has run out and that the answer was counted as incorrect.

The quiz will then advance to the next question and reset the 30 second timer. It will repeat this function until the quiz is finished.
